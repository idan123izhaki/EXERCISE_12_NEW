idan:"ALICE was beginning to get very tired of"
idan:"sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having"
idan:"nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into"
idan:"the book her sister was reading, but it had no"
idan:"pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is"
idan:"the use of a book,” thought Alice, “ without"
idan:"pictures or conversations ?”"
idan:"So she was considering in her own mind,"
idan:"(as well as she could, for the hot day made"
idan:"her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the"
idan:"pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be"
idan:"worth the trouble of getting up and picking"
idan:"the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with"
idan:"pink eyes ran close by her."
idan:"There was nothing so very remarkable in"
idan:"that; nor did Alice think it so very much out"
idan:"of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,"
idan:"“ Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late !”"
idan:"(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred"
idan:"to her that she ought to have wondered"
idan:"at this, but at the time it all seemed quite"
idan:"natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a"
idan:"watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at"
idan:"it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her"
idan:"feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had"
idan:"never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket"
idan:"or a watch to take out of it, and,"
idan:"burning with curiosity, she ran across the field"
idan:"after it, and was just in time to see it pop"
idan:"down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge."
